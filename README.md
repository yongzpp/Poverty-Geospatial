# Poverty-Geospatial

## Geospatial Analysis on Poverty Levels and Loans.

This project stems from the motivation to alleviate poverty. The scope includes: 
1) Evaluating on the effectiveness of current loan distributions
2) Understanding contributing factors to poverty and their correlations
3) Recommendation of distirbution patterns 
4) Proposed alternative measurements of poverty index

## Summary of Methods Used:
1) Descriptive Analysis
    - Kernel Density Estimates
      - Clustering of Loan Applications made
    - Nearest Neighbour Analysis
      - Spatial arrangement of Loan Applications
2) Spatial Data Analysis
    - Global / Local Moran's and Spatial Autoregression
      - Explore hotspots for loans distributions
    - Spatial Interpolation
      - Interpolate continuous measurements to find correlations
    - Point Poisson Process and Likelihood Ratio Test
      - Test for signifcance of covariates
